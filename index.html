        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>This is my personal website, showcasing my talents and projects and personality. Checkout my End of Days clock, that was my first app idea years ago. I was finally able to build it thanks to ChatGPT.</p>
        <p>I have an associate's degree in Music, and a BA in Psych. I've wanted to be a data scientist in educational psychology for years, but I'm a lowly car salesperson currently. I enjoy my job.</p>
        <p>Some projects I'm working on are mentioned or shown here. Feel free to reach out to me if you've got a cool idea if you want my input or to collab on. I'm happy to help anyone if I'm able.</p>
